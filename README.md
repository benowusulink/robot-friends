## Additional notes

1. I understand that one reducer should be used within one app.
   This app has 2 reducers to help showchase my ability with reducers.

2. There are some unit testing files which i have decided not to
   delete, I have not yet perfected the art of unit testing but in the
   process of perfecting it and decided to show some files to showcase
   how i approach to learning new methods bytesting them on existing apps
   amongst other things.
